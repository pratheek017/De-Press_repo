# De-Press_repo
De=Press app repo.

App that calculates the amount of time spent on each app and gives an analysis of how much mental energy is being wasted on mobile apps on a daily basis.

PS: This project is currently on hold because Android does not allow accessing information of other apps. Trying to research work arounds.
